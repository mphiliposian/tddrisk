# Definition of Done
- The program is "done" when it can determin a winner according to the rules and procedures of the game risk.
- A player is determined to be the winner when that player controls all 42 of the game's territories.
- A territory is defined as a cell which must contain at least one unit, and may only contain one player's units. The player whose units occupy a territory is said to control this territory.
- Territories are connected by routes. Routes are listed in appendix A.
- A unit is an abstract representation of a player's military force. Units are measured and represented as integers.

## Setup
- There are 3 to 6 players. The program assigns each player a unique identifier. The territories under a player's control will be marked with this identifier. 
- At the start of the game, each player is provided with a number of units corresponding to the number of players in the game. These values are provided in appendix B.
